# Infonomic Style Guides

Development at Infonomic mainly follows other 'best practice' guides and documentation - including the 'best parts' from the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) 

The style guides here are meant to supplement other guides with current practices at Infonomic - not all of which are perfect, but will evolve over time. These guides are primarily designed to assist new developers in producing code and modules that will look familiar to everyone, making code easier to read, review, and maintain.
