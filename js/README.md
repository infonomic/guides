# Infonomic JavaScript Style Guide

JavaScript development at Infonomic mainly follows other 'best practice' guides and documentation - including the 'best parts' from the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) 

This style guide supplements other guides with current practices at Infonomic - not all of which are perfect, but will evolve over time. It's primarily designed to assist new developers in producing code and modules that will look familiar to everyone, making code easier to read, review, and maintain.
